Safe Word is a Google Chrome extension that monitors the websites a user visits to alert them of security flaws; it catalogs insecure websites in a database with their violations.  The database is visualized at safeword.pedelen.com.

Safe Word, meant to keep passwords safe online, was built at HackDFW 2016 using Node.js, MongoDB, AngularJS, and HTML/CSS.

Safe Word was created by: Jack Baumann, Justin Hill, Patrick Edelen, Brian Richer, and The Nicholas for HackDFW 2016
