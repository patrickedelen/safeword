Safe Word is a Google Chrome extension that monitors the websites a user visits to alert them of security flaws; it catalogs insecure websites in a database with their violations.  The database is visualized at safeword.pedelen.com.

Safe Word, meant to keep passwords safe online, was built at HackDFW 2016 using Node.js, MongoDB, AngularJS, and HTML/CSS.

Safe Word was created by: [Jack Baumann](https://github.com/JackBmann), [Justin Hill](https://github.com/jhillkwaj), [Patrick Edelen](https://github.com/patrickedelen), [Brian Richer](https://github.com/zapper59), and [The Nicholas](https://github.com/killVung) for HackDFW 2016
